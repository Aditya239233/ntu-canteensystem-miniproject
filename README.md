# Real-time Canteen Information System

### Mini Project for CZ1003 Introduction to Computational Thinking

The application made is a Real-time Canteen Information System solely for North Spine Plaza in NTU. 
- This application has a Graphic User Interface which has been made using the PyQt package in python. 
- The menu of each stall is displayed in the interface based on the current date and time.
- The program is user friendly and allows the user to customize the date and time, accordingly the menu of the stalls is displayed. 
- Moreover, the user can calculate the waiting time by entering the number of people in front of the user in the queue. The application also allows the user to check the operating hours of each shop.
